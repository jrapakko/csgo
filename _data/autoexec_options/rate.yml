  name: Interpolation Value (Delay)
  desc: |
    Generally good to be as low as possible, this gets quite complicated (See: <a href=https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_Multiplayer_Networking#Entity_interpolation>Valve Developer Wiki: Source Multiplayer Networking</a> for more info)
    A value of 0 should autoset this to the lowest your client is capable of

  desc: |
    Used as a ratio to calculate your lowest cl_interp value (See: <a href=https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_Multiplayer_Networking#Entity_interpolation>Valve Developer Wiki: Source Multiplayer Networking</a> for more info)
    Recommend that you set this to 1 for best results.
